              <h3>Whisker Fatigue:</h3>
              <p>
                Cats' whiskers are highly sensitive and serve to gather
                information about their surroundings. However, too much
                stimulation can lead to whisker fatigue, causing stress. This is
                why some cats may pull their food out of their bowls to eat from
                the sides. (Source: American Veterinary Medical Association)

              <h3>Purring for Healing:</h3>
              <p>
                Cats' purring isn't just a sign of contentment; it's also
                believed to have healing properties. The frequency of a cat's
                purr, around 25-150 Hertz, is thought to promote the healing of
                bones, reduce pain and inflammation, and aid in tissue repair.

            <h3>Kneading Behavior:</h3>
            <p>
              Cats often "knead" with their paws, pressing them into surfaces.
              This behavior, which mimics kittenhood kneading to stimulate milk
              flow from their mother, is a sign of comfort and contentment in
              adult cats. (Source: The Humane Society)

            <h3>Cat Communication:</h3>
            <p>
              Cats have a unique way of communicating with their owners and
              other cats. They use a combination of vocalizations (meows, purrs,
              hisses), body language (tail flicks, ear movements), and scent
              marking to convey their feelings and intentions. (Source:
              International Cat Care)

            <h3>Nocturnal Hunters:</h3>
            <p>
              Cats are crepuscular animals, meaning they are most active during
              the dawn and dusk. This behavior is a result of their evolutionary
              history as solitary hunters, allowing them to take advantage of
              low light conditions when their prey is active. (Source: The
              Spruce Pets)
            </p>
          </li>

            <h3>Territorial Marking:</h3>
            <p>
              Cats have scent glands on their face, paws, and tail, which they
              use to mark their territory by rubbing against objects. This
              behavior helps them establish a sense of familiarity and safety in
              their environment. (Source: Cornell University College of
              Veterinary Medicine)

            <h3>Flexible Skeletons:</h3>
            <p>
              Cats are known for their agility and flexibility, thanks to their
              unique skeletal structure. They have a flexible spine with more
              vertebrae than humans, allowing them to twist and turn their
              bodies with exceptional grace and precision. (Source: Live
              Science)

            <h3>Variety of Vocalizations:</h3>
            <p>
              Cats have an impressive range of vocalizations, from the friendly
              meow to the demanding yowl. While they do communicate with humans
              through meowing, cats primarily use these vocalizations to
              communicate with other cats. (Source: The Humane Society)
            </p>

            <h3>Grooming Rituals:</h3>
            <p>
              Cats spend a significant amount of time grooming themselves. This
              behavior not only helps them keep clean but also serves to
              regulate body temperature, promote social bonding among cats, and
              distribute natural oils across their fur. (Source: National
              Geographic)

            <h3>Superior Night Vision:</h3>
            <p>
              Cats possess exceptional night vision due to a high concentration
              of rod cells in their retinas. They can see in light levels six
              times lower than what a human needs, making them effective
              nocturnal hunters. (Source: American Association for the
              Advancement of Science)
